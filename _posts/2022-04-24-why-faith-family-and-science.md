# Why Faith, Family, and Science

I'm going to tell you why I am starting this blog. That's not because I think you need
to know, but because I think it will help you know what to expect.

Let me start by telling you what a typical Sunday has looked like for me recently. After
researching <span class="tooltip">until just before midnight
    <span class="tooltiptext">I don't work on Sundays as part of my
    personal efforts to keep the Sabbath day holy.</span></span><sup>[1][sabbath-day]</sup>
on Saturday night, I watch a few episodes of Japanese anime to relax. I don't have many opportunities to speak Japanese,
and so watching anime helps me think in Japanese more often and <span class="tooltip"> connect me back to a people and culture that I love
    <span class="tooltiptext">I served as a representative of
  Jesus Christ as a full-time missionary for two years in Japan from 2013 to
  2015.</span> </span><sup>[2][missionary]</sup>.
In the morning, we study <span class="tooltip"> scriptures
    <span class="tooltiptext">Scriptures are inspired texts recorded by ancient prophets
    as directed by God. I study from the Bible (Old and New Testaments), The Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and
    the Pearl of Great Price.</span></span><sup>[3][scriptures]</sup>
together as a family. My wife, V, and I each read one column of a
page, and do some wrangling/entertainment for our daughter, N, while the other is reading. After
reading (and discussing depending on how we're all doing), we <span class="tooltip"> pray
    <span class="tooltiptext">Prayer is a conversation with God, during
    which we can express gratitude and ask for help and guidance in our lives. See page 303
    of the The Book of Mormon, Alma 37:37: "Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good"</span></span><sup>[4][prayer],[5][prayer-2]</sup>
together. I head back to sleep until it's time to get ready for <span class="tooltip">church
  <span class="tooltiptext">Each Sunday, we go to church for a two hour meeting that
  usually consists of prayer, singing, sermons followed by breaking out into
  age-specific lessons and discussions. The most important part of Sunday is the
  Sacrament which helps us to remember Jesus Christ and renew promises we've made to
  follow Him.</span></span><sup>[6][church],[7][church-2]</sup>.
Sometimes we leave together as a family and sometimes V leaves earlier, in which case
I meet up with V and N at our church building nearby.

At church, we listen to inspiring messages and discuss and learn how to become more like
Jesus Christ - by serving, loving, forgiving, and improving each day. Our daughter likes
to crawl up to where our <span class="tooltip">bishop
  <span class="tooltiptext">A bishop is the leader of a congregration
  who makes sure that people's needs are met. A bishop serves on a volunteer basis, and
  the assignment to be bishop, as with other assignments in the church, rotates
  periodically.</span> </span><sup>[8][bishop]</sup>
sits and say hi, after which we retrieve her and start again.
Today, we heard from two speakers from our congregation that spoke about messages that
impressed or inspired each of them from a recent <span class="tooltip">general conference
  <span class="tooltiptext">General conference is a global, bi-annual
  broadcast of "talks from religious leaders and performances of sacred music" where
  we "hear from modern-day prophets about God's message for us today".</span>
  </span><sup>[9][general-conference]</sup>
One of the speakers at church today, an engineering student attending
University of Utah, talked about how <span class="tooltip">President Nelson's
    <span class="tooltiptext">President Nelson is the prophet and President
    of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (2018-present).</span>
    </span><sup>[10][prophet]</sup>
recent general conference address on [_The Power of Spiritual
Momentum_](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/47nelson)
resonated with him. This talk stuck out to me as well, as I considered the "direction"
and "speed" with which I (the "mass") am headed spiritually. An encouraging thought came
to mind - if I set my direction correctly, no matter how fast or slowly I am
progressing, eventually I will reach my "mokuteki" (目的 goal) and "ikisaki" (行先
destination).

As I listened to the talks of the most recent general conference (held April 2-3, 2022),
I felt inspired to start a blog; as I considered further what I might write about, I
realized that there are three distinct aspects of my life that are of utmost importance
to me: my faith in Jesus Christ, my family, and my goal to make a positive impact on the
world through scientific innovation. Hence the name: "Faith, Family, and Science".
