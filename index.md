# Hi, 👋 I'm Sterling

I am a member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/). I am married to a fun, practical, hilarious, and spunky mechanical engineer who I will refer to as V. We have a small kiddo that is learning, growing, and exploring the world, who I will refer to as N. I am also a [materials scientist that develops data science tools](https://citrine.io/what-is-materials-informatics/) to understand and discover new materials. Alternatively, I am a data scientist that looks for interesting materials science problems to tackle using state-of-the-art machine learning methods.
