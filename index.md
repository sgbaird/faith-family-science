# Hi, 👋 I'm Sterling

⛪ I am a member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/).

👨‍👩‍👦 I am married to a fun, practical,
hilarious, and spunky mechanical engineer 🔧 who I will refer to as V. We have a small
kiddo 👶 that is learning, growing, and exploring the world, who I will refer to as N.

🧑‍🔬 I am also a [materials scientist that develops data science
tools](https://citrine.io/what-is-materials-informatics/) to understand and discover new
materials. Alternatively, I am a data scientist that looks for interesting materials science problems to tackle using state-of-the-art machine learning methods.
