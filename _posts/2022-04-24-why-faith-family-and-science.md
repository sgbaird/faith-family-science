I'm going to tell you why I am starting this blog. That's not because I think you need to know, but because I think it will help you know what to expect.

Let me start by telling you what a typical Sunday has looked like for me recently. After researching

until just before midnight</a> on Saturday night, I watch a few episodes of Japanese anime to relax. I don't have many opportunities to speak Japanese, and so watching anime helps me think in Japanese more often and <!-- <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="I served as a representative of Jesus Christ as a full-time missionary for two years in Japan from 2013 to 2015.">

 In the morning, we study <!-- <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title=""> scriptures</a> -->
[scriptures](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures?lang=eng&platform=web "Scriptures are inspired texts recorded by ancient prophets as directed by God. I study from the Bible (Old and New Testaments), The Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price.")
together as a family. V and I each read one column of a page, and do some wrangling/entertainment for N while the other is reading. After reading (and discussing depending on how we're all doing), we

pray</a> together. I head back to sleep until it's time to get ready for church. Sometimes we leave together as a family and sometimes V leaves earlier, in which case I meet up with V and N at our church building nearby.

At church, we listen to inspiring messages and discuss and learn how to become more like Jesus Christ - by serving, loving, forgiving, and improving each day. Our daughter likes to crawl up to where our <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/belong/a-place-for-everyone/a-church-of-volunteers" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="A bishop is the leader of a congregration who makes sure that people's needs are met.

President Nelson's</a> recent general conference address on [_The Power of Spiritual Momentum_](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/47nelson) resonated with him. This talk stuck out to me as well, as I considered the "direction" and "speed" with which I (the "mass") am headed spiritually. An encouraging thought came to mind - if I set my direction correctly, no matter how fast or slowly I am progressing, eventually I will reach my "mokuteki" (goal) and "ikisaki" (destination).

As I listened to the talks of the most recent general conference (held April 2-3, 2022), I felt inspired to start a blog; as I considered further what I might write about, I realized that there are three distinct aspects of my life that are of utmost importance to me: my faith in Jesus Christ, my family, and my goal to make a positive impact on the world through scientific innovation. Hence the name: "Faith, Family, and Science".
