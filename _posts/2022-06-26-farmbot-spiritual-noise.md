# Automated Gardening and Missionary Work

At church today, at the start of
<span class="tooltip"> elders quorum
    <span class="tooltiptext">
        "In addition to the group worship that happens during Sunday services, every
        congregation of the Church has an organization for men called the elders quorum.
        The name comes from the Bible, where men who served in the priesthood were often
        referred to as elders. A quorum is another word for a group of people united by
        a shared purpose. In the case of the elders quorum, that purpose is to come
        together and help each other serve as better sons, brothers, husbands, fathers,
        and members of the community. Members also work together to fulfill
        congregational assignments, build unity, and learn about Jesus." [(source)][elders-quorum]

, the instructor opened the floor for people to share questions that have been on their
mind. As I mentioned in a previous post, I've been thinking about the idea of robotic
gardening and shared the following thoughts during the lesson:

- There is very little that I've put into practice or started really experimenting with.
- I enjoy the idea of gardening automation, but actually getting
  started will probably be even more rewarding
- "be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only" ([James 1:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/1?lang=eng&id=22-25#p22))
- A deeper joy and fulfillment comes from putting into practice the teachings and doctrines of Jesus Christ

If you've read [another post of
mine](https://sgbaird.github.io/faith-family-science/2022/05/01/why-faith.html), it will
probably come as no surprise that missionary work is important to me. After all, I spent
two years as a full-time volunteer missionary in a foreign country with the primary
purpose of helping others come unto Christ. While my full-time missionary service came
to a close, my desire to share the Gospel of Jesus Christ with others has not. This
starts in my family, as N learns to pray with V and myself, and it extends to close
friends, acquantainces, neighbors, and even strangers. Like how I've had trouble getting
started with the gardening automation hobby that I'd like to try out, sometimes I have
trouble bringing the desire to be a missionary into practice. Some of the reasons are
shared:

- My schedule is flexible, but often packed to the brim; how can I spare the additional
  time?
- The efforts might result in (at least a perceived) failure. What if I get started, and
  this is the case?
- What if others think or act negatively in response to my actions? (in the case
  of gardening, theft/vandalism of the equipment is a real possibility, while in the
  case of missionary work, I worry about becoming a [social
  pariah](https://www.google.com/search?q=social+pariah), losing friendships and
  opportunities)

Recently, I felt impressed to [post on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/SterlingBaird1/status/1540516208046247936):

of Latter-day Saints' views in the context of the recent US Supreme Court ruling
https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/churchs-position-on-abortion" width=450></center>

All three of the above concerns were at play here. Can I spare the additional time to
decide how/what to post? The post might get ignored or go unseen. What if this spurs
contention rather than mutual understanding and respect?

It did take some time for me to consider how to act on the impression to write the post;
however, this was well-spent time reflecting on my personal beliefs. While it isn't (and
certainly wasn't intended) to be a viral post, it also didn't go unnoticed. I wasn't
speaking to an empty room, nor was I in an echo chamber where most everyone would
already share the same perspectives. Some people may have been offended, put off, or
felt uncomfortable in response to my post; however, so far, it doesn't seem to have
stirred up contention. By contrast, I was impressed by a colleague's later remarks and
open, respectful sharing of his views on the subject. This helped me to consider the
disentanglement of two complex, intertwined topics and fit very well with one of the
discussions in church today about filtering out the signal(s) from the noise in
divisive topics. Noticing parallels with

anyone?

[Circling back a bit](https://sgbaird.github.io/faith-family-science/2022/05/29/science.html), I was reading a a [hackaday post about a
TacoBot](https://hackaday.com/2022/06/22/an-impressively-functional-tacobot/) which led
me to another post about [FarmBot](https://farm.bot/) (!) I've been talking with V about
it, and we're seriously considering purchasing one within the next couple years
