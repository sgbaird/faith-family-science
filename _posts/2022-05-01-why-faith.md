# Faith

Some people might say "I was born a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints"; however, that's not quite right. What they usually mean is that they were born
into a family with parents and/or siblings that are members and that they were brought
up being taught the principles of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. As early as age eight,
someone can decide whether or not they will become a member of the Church of Jesus
Christ through
[baptism](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/article/baptism), which is
a covenant or promise that we make with God to obey his commandments and to follow Jesus
Christ in our words, thoughts, and actions. After someone is baptized:
> those with proper priesthood authority place their hands on the baptized person’s head
> to confirm him or her a member of the Church and give the gift of the Holy Ghost. When
> someone receives the Holy Ghost, it means the person may have the Holy Spirit with
> them as a constant companion to comfort and guide them and to witness of truth.

This was the case with me. When I was born, both of my parents were (and still are)
members. At age eight, I was presented with the choice of whether or not to be baptized,
and I chose to do so. My dad baptized me and also helped to confirm me a member of the
Church. Over the last two decades, there have been many times where I have felt inspired
to do something (or not to do something), when I have prayed and felt comforted, or when
I've I've felt an increased conviction of the reality of [Jesus
Christ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe/jesus) as my Savior,
[Joseph Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1V9IyiJehfE) as a prophet of God, and the
[Book of
Mormon](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/believe/book-of-mormon/what-is-the-book-of-mormon)
as another testament of Jesus Christ.

One experience that has really stuck with me was during my full-time [missionary
service](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/belong/share-goodness/10-things-to-know-about-missionaries)
in Japan from 2013-2015. One of my [missionary
companions](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/belong/share-goodness/who-are-the-missionaries)
and I were headed somewhere on bicycles, and I felt impressed to turn around and go
another route.

My companion, understandably a bit reluctant, consented and we turned around. Within the
next minute or two, we happened upon two of our friends who were struggling, unbeknownst
to us, and we were able to help them in the coming weeks and months.

This is an experience that built my
[faith](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/faith-in-jesus-christ?lang=eng)
in the reality of the Holy Spirit, who:
> can guide us throughout our lives. As we prayerfully ask God for help, His Holy Spirit
> “will show unto you all things what ye should do” (2 Nephi 32:5). One of the ways God
> communicates with us is through the Holy Ghost. The Holy Spirit speaks to our mind and
> to our hearts through thoughts and feelings.
